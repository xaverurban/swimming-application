 * This class provides an interactive menu-driven application for managing a list of swimmers and their associated races.
 * It offers functionality to add, search, list, update, and delete swimmers, as well as manage their races.
 * The SwimmerApp interacts with the SwimmerAPI and uses a Serializer object to support storing and loading swimmer data.
 * It allows users to perform various operations on swimmers such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, and archiving swimmers.
 * Additionally, this class provides functionality to add, update, and delete races associated with swimmers.
 * Users can also search for swimmers by name and races by their description.
